# RAII Practice â€“ Modern C++

This repository contains my personal practice programs exploring **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** using modern C++ concepts. All code demonstrates safe and automatic resource management using C++'s standard library.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- `read_file.cpp` â€“ Reads a line from a file using `std::ifstream`
- `write_file.cpp` â€“ Writes to a file using `std::ofstream`
- `user_input.cpp` â€“ Combines file I/O with user input/output
- `main.cpp` â€“ Combined example for reading, writing, and handling input/output

## âœ¨ Concepts Covered

- RAII with `std::ifstream` and `std::ofstream`
- Safe resource management using scopes
- Modern C++ I/O patterns
- Basic error handling with `if (!file)`

## ðŸš€ Why This Exists

I'm learning **modern C++** alongside **Rust**, and I use hands-on code instead of traditional notes. This repo is part of my journey in mastering C++23 features and good coding practices.
